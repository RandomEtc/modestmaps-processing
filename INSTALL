Copy the /modestmaps folder to your Processing libraries folder.

On a Mac, this should be in Documents/Processing/libraries, so you
will have the following folder structure:

/Documents
  /Processing
    /my_awesome_sketch
    /art_and_science
    /sticks_and_rocks
    /CIA_dashboard
    /i_am_rich_2
    /libraries
      /some_library
      /another_library
      /modestmaps
        /library
          /modestmaps.jar
